				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<p class="lead">
					Hi, I'm {AUTHOR_NAME}, a full-stack software engineer with 10+ years of experience
					building scalable systems and leading modernization efforts in SaaS companies.
				</p>

				<h2>Professional Journey</h2>

				<p>
					Throughout my career, I've specialized in transforming legacy monolithic systems into
					modern, efficient microservice architectures. Most recently, I worked as a Staff Software
					Engineer at <strong>LeagueApps</strong>, where I spearheaded the transformation of
					a 13-year-old Java monolith into modern Golang microservices.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've had the privilege of working with innovative companies like <strong>Dapper Labs</strong>
					(where I reduced cloud costs by half a million dollars), <strong>InVision</strong>
					(increasing ARR by 10%), <strong>Roblox</strong>, and <strong>OpenTable</strong>, among others.
					My experience spans from startups to high-growth companies, always focusing on delivering
					tangible value and scalable solutions.
				</p>

				<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>

				<p>
					I specialize in backend development with <strong>Go</strong> and <strong>TypeScript/Node.js</strong>,
					building microservices and distributed systems. My work focuses on:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Microservices architecture and distributed systems</li>
					<li>Backend development with Go, Node.js, and TypeScript</li>
					<li>Cloud cost optimization and performance</li>
					<li>Billing system integrations (Stripe, Zuora, Plaid)</li>
					<li>Developer productivity improvements</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Commitment to Transparency</h2>

				<p>
					Beyond software engineering, I'm deeply passionate about government transparency and
					open data initiatives, particularly in Mexico. I believe technology can play a crucial
					role in making government more accessible and accountable to citizens.
				</p>
